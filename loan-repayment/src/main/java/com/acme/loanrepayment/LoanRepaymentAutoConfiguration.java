/**
 * The second workflow module wires itself the same way the first one does, and that is the
 * point of the recipe: it is one class plus one registration file, identical in every
 * module, so an application can collect modules without knowing anything about them.
 *
 * <p>
 * Including the bean name generator, which is what keeps the two modules apart: both have a
 * class called {@code Service} and one called {@code ApiController}, and Spring's default
 * names them after the class alone. Here they are called
 * {@code loan-repayment_<SimpleName>}.
