/**
 * The workflow module wires itself. This class is what turns a JAR into something an
 * application can simply depend on.
 *
 * <p>
 * A Spring Boot application scans its own package and everything below it. This module is
 * not below it, deliberately: it is a JAR somebody else may consume, and in a real project
 * it comes from a registry rather than from the directory next door. So the module says
 * what it contributes, once, and every application using it is spared the knowledge:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code @ComponentScan} for its beans - the service, the wiring classes, the API -
 * named {@code loan-approval_<SimpleName>} by {@link LoanApprovalBeanNames}. That is not
 * decoration: every use case of the reference structure has a class called {@code Service}
 * and one called {@code ApiController}, so two modules in one application would otherwise
 * fight over the bean name {@code apiController} and the second one to be registered ends
 * the boot,</li>
 * <li>{@code @EntityScan} and {@code @EnableJpaRepositories} for its aggregate and the
 * repository reading it,</li>
 * <li>{@code @EnableConfigurationProperties} for the properties class fed from
 * {@code loan-approval/loan-approval.yaml}.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * Registered in
 * {@code META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports},
 * which Spring Boot reads from every JAR on the classpath. Without that file the class is
 * just a class, and the symptom is the one the README describes: the application starts
 * until VanillaBP looks for the bean behind a {@code @WorkflowTask} method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * What VanillaBP finds on its own is only the BPMN wiring: it scans the classpath for
 * {@code @WorkflowService} classes itself, so the process is known even when the bean
 * behind it is not. That is why the failure names a missing bean rather than a missing
 * module.
 * </p>
