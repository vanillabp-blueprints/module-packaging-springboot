/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan approval,
 * expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP. Whenever the business case moves on, it tells {@link Workflow}
 * what happened, {@code loanRequested} rather than "start the process", and that class
 * decides what this means for the BPMN. The other direction runs through
 * {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}, which calls the methods below when the process reaches a
 * task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both directions meet here, and that is the point: this is the one class describing the
 * use case, and it does so without naming a single BPMN element.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the method the API calls, because
 * starting a workflow has to run in a transaction. It is deliberately absent from the
 * methods a task handler calls: VanillaBP already runs a task in a transaction it owns,
 * and it commits that transaction for a {@code TaskException} on purpose. A transaction
 * declared here would roll back instead and throw away what the handler wrote for the
 * process to react to. VanillaBP sees the transaction it can no longer commit and fails the
 * task naming it, so the mistake shows up rather than costing data.
